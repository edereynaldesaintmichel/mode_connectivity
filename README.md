# Mode connectivity
Here are some scripts to explore mode connectivity in small CNNs trained on the MNSIT dataset.

Nothing too fancy here, I just wanted to test if merging two CNNs trained on two random, distinct, equal size subsets of a certain dataset would result in a model with better performances on unseen (test) data. 

It looks like it depends on numerous factors.
